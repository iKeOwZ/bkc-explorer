## About BiktubChain Explorer

Bitkub Chain Explorer is an Elixir application that allows users to search transactions, view accounts and balances, and verify smart contracts on the Biktub Chain network including all block data and transactions.

Currently available full-featured block explorers (Etherscan, Etherchain, Blockchair) are closed systems which are not independently verifiable.  As Ethereum sidechains continue to proliferate in both private and public settings, transparent, open-source tools are needed to analyze and validate transactions.

## BiktubChain Supported Projects

Biktub Chain supports a number of projects. Hosted instances include POA Network, xDai Chain, Ethereum Classic, Sokol & Kovan testnets, and other EVM chains.
